DeepONet code to train a deep operator network for mapping from XANES data to EXAFS dataCode by Amanda HowardTo accompany “A machine learning approach to interpreting x-ray spectra by converting XANES to EXAFS”Micah Prange, Amanda Howard, Niranjan Govind, Panos Stinis, Eugene IltonInput files: ‘input.txt’ contains two integers, the initial and final indices of the XANES profile used in training. If input.txt does not exist in the output folder, default values will be used. Usage: 1) To train a DeepONet and save the outputs, run DeepONet.py2) To plot the predictions generated by the DeepONet for FEFF values, run Plot_results_FEFFpyThis research was supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
